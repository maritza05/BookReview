== A cool App built with Ruby on Rails

Hi everyone! This is the repo for a cool website where we let users review different categories
for books, this website let me practice with ruby on rails for one of my future
projects where I could apply some cool features that I learned in this project:

* A 5 stars rating system.

* A classifier for the different types of books.

* Adding images for every book with the paperclip gem.

* User management and registration system.
